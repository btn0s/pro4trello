		<h2>Why should you support development?</h2>
		<p>
			Pro for Trello is a free Google Chrome extension. It will always be free. You will likely appreciate that:
		</p>
		<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
			<li>Your Trello experience remains <strong>ads-free</strong></li>
			<li>There are <strong>no banners</strong> obstructing your work</li>
			<li>You are <strong>not forced to make any sacrifices or compromises</strong> as all settings are customizable - so you chose what you use.</li>
			<li>The extension is <strong>safe</strong>, code is OPEN and it is not trying to steal or sell your data or inject affiliate cookies or track you</li>
			<li>The author is maintaining the extension and is as responsive as he can achieve considering he is running multple projects and a business</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Whether or not you decide to support the author will not likely change the above. But it sure could <strong>make a difference</strong>.
		</p>
